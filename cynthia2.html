            <h1>PAN-AFRICAN YOUTH AMBASSADORS FOR INTERNET GOVERNANCE 2023 (PAYAIG) – 
SWAHILI FACILITATOR
</h1>
<strong>March 2023 – November 2023</strong>
            <div class="line-break"></div>
<div class="card--work-history">
            <p>2023 IGF focused on the theme "The Internet We Want - Empowering All People". On this project I worked with PAYAIG as a Swahili Facilitator/Trainer for the Swahili Cohort Fellows. I took fellows through the topic on "Utangulizi wa Utawa Wa Mtandao (Introduction to Internet Governance)" and "Masuala ya Kisheria na Kiuchumi karika Utawala wa Mtandao (Legal and Economic Issues in Internet Governance)"

The PAYAIG Initiative, developed by Cyber Czar and generously backed by the UK Government, in collaboration with AUC PRIDA, IGF Secretariat, as well as several regional NRIs and IGF stakeholders, successfully empowered over 1000 young Africans between the ages of 18-30 to engage actively and meaningfully in internet governance discussions and foster Africa’s internet governance ecosystem.
