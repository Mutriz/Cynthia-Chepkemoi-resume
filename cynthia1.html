            <h1>RESEARCH ASSOCIATE – EDGELANDS INSTITUTE  </h1>
            <strong>October 2022 - Ongoing</strong>
            <div class="line-break"></div>
<div class="card--work-history">
            <p>The Edgelands Institute is a multi-disciplinary organization that uses academic research, data, and art to explore how the digitalization of urban security is changing the urban social contract — the often-unseen rules that govern our cities. We create pop-up spaces “research sprints” that bring citizens, policymakers, academics, and other stakeholders into dialogue about the way that digital tools are being used by city governments and transforming urban social fabric.</p>
